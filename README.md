# GPTuring

[_GPTuring_](https://github.com/ZE-100/GPTuring/) - pronounced _GP-Turing_ - is an IntelliJ IDEA plugin that helps developers work efficiently with
their code base, understand exceptions more easily, generate code automatically and much more, by providing 'chat-like'
AI-features.

And the best thing about it? **_It_ doesn't share any data!** _GPTuring_ hosts a local GPT-3.5 model instance and
requires no internet connection!

## The plugin is intended to:

* Boost productivity, by writing (bulk) code
* Help developers simplify exception messages
* ...

## GPTuring delivers:

* Chat feature to send and receive data
* Autofill features

_GPTuring_ keeps growing and - by any means - isn't perfect.
